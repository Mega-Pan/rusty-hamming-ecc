# rusty-hamming-ecc

## About 
This is a educational rust hamming code ECC (error-checking-code)

This encoding method is by generating the encoding block with dynamic size. In which is not a very typical way to encode. I will rewrite it in future work.

## Usage
``` Script
$ cargo run   // run interactive prompt
$ cargo test  // run unit test
```
